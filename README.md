## Description
Latest News is a web application that displays a list of various news sources. On choosing a news source, it will preview the top news articles of the day. Clicking a news article will redirect the user to read it fully from the news source. It achieves this by using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

## User Stories
These are the behaviours/features that the application implements for use by a user.

* See various news sources
* Select the ones they prefer
* See the top news articles from that news source
* See the image, description and time the news article was created
* Click on an article and read it fully from the news source
